# Resume checkpoint

Write the handoff for the current subject now. Do not ask which form to produce.

The record is primary. Carry every session item the record does not yet hold; do not
require reconciliation or persistence before checkpointing. Never commit, merge, or push
as part of a checkpoint. Do not carry a live ticket list, project status, runtime posture,
or monitor doctrine.

Supply the handoff's judgment-bearing fields: a one-line `resume.headline`, concrete
`resume.next_action`, a one-line `resume.session_summary` of what this session did,
short anchored or disposed `resume.open_loops`, `spawned_processes`, and `suggested_skills`.
Pass all unrecorded session items in `session_items`. Each needs `type` (progress,
commitment, decision, knowledge, lesson, artifact, or open_loop), `context` (at most
600 characters), `disposition`, `session_id` of its producer, and `produced_at` (ISO
timestamp with timezone). Decisions also need `author` and `location` (where decided).
Lessons carry the lesson text in `context`, not a pointer. Only items already saved in
the record may have `recorded: true`; those are omitted. Already-carried items stay in
`resume.open_loops` with their original identity and date until a binding consumes them.
Preserve `resume.session_history` from a resumed handoff, so earlier summaries keep
their producing session's identity. Update `resume.session_summary` to describe the
current session: the module records it under the calling session ID, including when
checkpointing a payload whose subject still names the prior session.

Files and published artifacts come from the ledger. Write/Edit hook events record
file paths. After each shell-driven file change, register its path explicitly:

```bash
python3 scripts/lib/handoff.py ledger-file <path> --cwd <checkout> --session-id <session>
```

Do not substitute a checkout-wide dirty-file list. Publishing tools call the single
artifact command:

```bash
python3 scripts/lib/handoff.py ledger-artifact --session-id <producer> \
  --cwd <subject> --location <published-location> --disposition keep
```

Use `remove` to mark an artifact for later removal; checkpoint does not remove it.
Once the record links it, call the same command with `--status recorded`; after actual
removal use `--status removed`. The ledger automatically supplies pending artifacts,
including a resumed session's carried artifacts. Never rebuild that list from memory.

The checkpoint module overwrites `written_at`, `trigger`, the current
subject, and git metadata from the real environment. Its trigger defaults to `checkpoint`;
callers needing another trigger set `HANDOFF_TRIGGER=wrap` or `HANDOFF_TRIGGER=manual`.

Pipe that JSON to the checkpoint module. It resolves the current subject, writes atomically,
lints the result, and prints the required paste block (prior-session banner, handoff location,
and next action):

`<checkpoint.sh>` is `scripts/checkpoint.sh` in this skill's real directory (resolve the
path from where this skill is installed, not from a tool-specific home directory).

```bash
bash <checkpoint.sh> <<'JSON'
<judgment-bearing handoff JSON>
JSON
```

If lint fails, the checkpoint was still written and the command reports the lint failure.
Report that failure; do not imply the handoff is clean.
