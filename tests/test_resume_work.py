"""#910 — resume_work.py (skills/resume-work/scripts/).

Two kinds of fixture, deliberately:

- tests/fixtures/resume-work-session.jsonl — a REDACTED COPY of a real
  transcript (see tests/fixtures/redact_resume_work_transcript.py for what
  was stripped and why). It keeps the record structure and no command,
  tool output, or thinking text, so assertions about commands and results
  (ticket operations, scraped paths) build their rows with
  ``_bash_call``, which clones a real tool_use/tool_result pair from the
  fixture and sets only the command and result text.
- a handful of small in-memory row dicts, used ONLY to reach edge-case
  branches the real session never hits (no stop_reason=="end_turn" row at
  all; a user row carrying a tool_result). These are minimal pure-function
  probes of a documented row SHAPE (see the docstrings on the functions
  under test), not a fabricated transcript standing in for a real one.

#910 eval round 1 reworked this suite for:
- F1: build_report() returns a single dict now (render_text/the report+extra
  dual shape are gone) — every call site here updated.
- F2: files_for_repo() no longer returns `reconciled`; assertions check
  membership in the three source lists directly.
- F4: commits_source / unresolved_branches, so a branch whose contribution
  could not be resolved is distinguishable from one that touched nothing.
- F6: an unreadable worktree (status_short() returning None) must classify
  as "unknown", not silently fall through to "merged".
- F7: the A1 test now uses a fixture where the last end_turn row is NOT the
  last row with any text, so it can actually fail if A1 regresses to
  "last row with any text" — asserted directly against the OLD algorithm's
  own answer, not against a description of it.
- F9: RESUME_WORK_TRUNK env override, so a master/trunk/develop repo is not
  silently misclassified.
