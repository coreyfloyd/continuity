# #909: resume-work.sh must resolve EVERY branch/worktree a
# session touched, not just the last-seen one, and classify each into the
# required states. This exercises the alarm paths (dirty, unmerged,
# deleted-with-no-merge) against a disposable, hermetic git repo -- no
# unmerged branch was reliably outstanding in the real sample transcript by
# the time this test was written (the sampled branch landed after the ticket
# was filed), so the alarm states need a constructed fixture.
#
# #910 eval round 1 (F1, F8) reworked this suite:
#   - resume-work.sh's directory lens is JSON-only now (no text render at
#     all), so this asserts against the parsed --json object's `branches[]`
#     structure directly, not grepped emoji/text lines. Case E's guard is
#     `merge_evidence is None`, which is strictly stronger than the old
#     `grep -F shared-scope | grep -Fq shared-scope-2` substring heuristic
#     (that heuristic would also fire on an unrelated co-occurrence).
#   - The row-shape template is the COMMITTED fixture
#     tests/fixtures/resume-work-session.jsonl, not a scan of the developer's
#     live $HOME/.claude/projects/*/*.jsonl. The live scan made this suite's
#     result depend on whatever happened to be on the box running it, and
#     silently reported PASS-shaped SKIP (exit 0) on a box with no local
#     transcript store.
